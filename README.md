# Twitter Data Analysis

Let's do some psychoanalysis! Following along with a few videos, but mostly inspired by these two: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_OZdbCzHUA and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si8zZHkufRY&t=444s. There's no DOM, so we're just printing in the terminal and using MatPlot to generate some (DOM-less!) graphs.

## Getting Started

I had to use `pip3` instead of `pip`:
`pip3 install textblob`

And then in order to use `textblob`, I had to run the following command: `/Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command`

Also important to `pip3 install scipy` and `pip3 install h5py`
