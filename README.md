# Twitter Data Analysis

Let's do some psychoanalysis! Following along with a few videos, but mostly inspired by this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_OZdbCzHUA. There's no DOM, so we're just printing in the terminal and using MatPlot to generate some (DOM-less!) graphs.

## Getting Started

I had to use `pip3` instead of `pip`: ```pip3 install tweepy
pip3 install textblob```

And then in order to use `textblob`, I had to run the following command: ```/Applications/Python\ 3.6/Install\ Certificates.command```
